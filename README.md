## Overview
The Movie Recommendation System aims to help users discover movies they will enjoy. The dataset includes key details such as:
- **Titles:** Names of the movies.
- **Genres:** Categories assigned to movies.
- **Scores:** Ratings assigned by critics or users.
- **Overviews:** Summaries describing movie plots.
- **Financial Data:** Budgets and revenues of movies.
- **Release Information:** Release dates and countries of origin.

The system is designed to incorporate advanced techniques like text embeddings for semantic search and comprehensive data visualizations to uncover trends.

## Features
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Removal of duplicates and handling missing values.
   - Normalization of numerical data (e.g., budget, revenue).
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Detailed analysis of scores, genres, and financial performance.
   - Visualizations to showcase trends and insights.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Computation of popularity scores and weighted ratings.

4. **Semantic Search Integration** (Upcoming):
   - Embedding-based recommendations using movie overviews.

5. **Content-Based Recommendation System**:
   - Personalized suggestions based on genres, ratings, and other features.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - **matplotlib**: Data visualization.
  - **sentence-transformers**: Generating text embeddings for semantic search (planned).
- **Development Environment**:
  - VS Code
  - Virtual Environment (venv) for dependency isolation.
